A very simple script that I made to hopefully help some people out. 

Not sure if it has been done before but here it is. 

Instead of copying and pasting 24/7 use this to auto-generate the list in qb-core/shared/vehicles.lua

Remember you would need to input the rest of the details cause adding a feature where it handles ALL the data, the user would then need to input that extra data in the list.txt. That is too longwinded - just edit it in Lua

As a developer, you should ALWAYS have some sort of backup of your files so I shouldn't need to say this but make sure to create a backup to avoid losing anything
